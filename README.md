# Employee Management System in C++

This project is a C++ program that manages employee information for a company. It demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and techniques while maintaining modular and efficient code.

## Features

- Stores employee information such as name, ID, and salary.
- Uses **constructor initializer lists** and **deep copy constructors**.
- Demonstrates the use of **this pointer**, **const functions**, and **static members**.
- Tracks total employees and company details.
- Supports **dynamic memory allocation** for employee objects.
- Demonstrates object handling techniques:
  - Passing objects to functions
  - Returning objects from functions
- Shows the difference between **shallow copy** and **deep copy**.

## Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Constructor, Copy Constructor)
- Memory Management (Dynamic allocation, Deep copy)
- Static and constant members
- Object handling in functions
- Data encapsulation and modular programming

## Usage

1. Compile the C++ code using any modern C++ compiler.
2. Run the program and follow prompts to enter employee information.
3. Observe how the program manages employee data and demonstrates deep copy.
